# Database Syncing - Remote to Local

This directory contains all files related to the Database Sync feature, which allows you to copy a remote (production) database to your local development environment using a secure API method.

## üìÅ Files in This Directory

### Local Files (Use on your dev machine)

| File | Purpose | Access |
|------|---------|--------|
| **`db_sync.php`** | Main user interface | `http://localhost/db-manager/database_syncing/db_sync.php` |
| **`sync_api.php`** | Local API backend | Called by db_sync.php (AJAX) |
| **`sync_config.php`** | Configuration (optional) | Included by sync_api.php |
| **`README.md`** | This file | Documentation |

### Production Files (Upload to production server)

| File | Upload To | Configure |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **`sync_remote_api.php`** | Production root (e.g., `yoursite.com/sync_remote_api.php`) | ‚úÖ Required |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Developers (Local Setup)

Access the sync tool at:
```
http://localhost/db-manager/database_syncing/db_sync.php
```

Or create a shortcut link from the main app.

### For Production Setup

1. Upload `sync_remote_api.php` to your production server
2. Configure the file (API key, DB credentials)
3. Create `config/ipAllowed.txt` with your local IP
4. Use the tool to sync databases

## üîê Security

This feature uses **6 layers of security**:

1. ‚úÖ Kill Switch (API disabled by default)
2. ‚úÖ Secret API Key (32+ character authentication)
3. ‚úÖ IP Whitelist (uses `config/ipAllowed.txt`)
4. ‚úÖ Time-Based Tokens (auto-expire every 5 minutes)
5. ‚úÖ Rate Limiting (max 10 requests/minute)
6. ‚úÖ Audit Logging (tracks all access attempts)

**Always disable the API or delete the production file after syncing!**

## üéØ Why API Method?

Most production servers block direct MySQL connections for security. This API method:

- ‚úÖ Works through HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80/443)
- ‚úÖ Works with phpMyAdmin-only hosting
- ‚úÖ Firewall-friendly
- ‚úÖ No need to expose MySQL port 3306
- ‚úÖ Multi-layer security
- ‚úÖ Works with any hosting (shared, VPS, cloud)
