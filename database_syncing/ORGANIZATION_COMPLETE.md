| `db_sync.php` | `database_syncing/db_sync.php` |
| `sync_api.php` | `database_syncing/sync_api.php` |
| `sync_config.php` | `database_syncing/sync_config.php` |
| `sync_remote_api.php` | `database_syncing/sync_remote_api.php` |

- ✅ `database_syncing/db_sync.php` - Templates and auth paths
- ✅ `database_syncing/sync_api.php` - Auth and config paths  
- ✅ `database_syncing/sync_config.php` - DB config path

## 🚀 New Access URL

**The sync tool is now accessed at:**

```
http://localhost/db-manager/database_syncing/db_sync.php
```

(Changed from: `http://localhost/db-manager/db_sync.php`)

---

## 📤 Production Upload

When uploading to production, the file location is **unchanged**:

**Local path:** `database_syncing/sync_remote_api.php`  
**Upload to:** `https://yoursite.com/sync_remote_api.php` (production root)

The file is in the `database_syncing/` folder locally for organization, but you still upload it to your production website root (not in a subfolder).

---

## 🔒 Security

`.gitignore` has been updated to exclude sensitive files:

```gitignore
database_syncing/sync_config.php       # May contain API keys
database_syncing/sync_remote_api.php   # Contains DB credentials  
sync_audit.log                         # Contains access logs
```

## ✨ Benefits of Organization

1. **Cleaner Root** - Sync files no longer clutter the main directory
2. **Easy to Find** - All sync-related files in one place
3. **Better Organization** - Clear separation of features
4. **Easier Maintenance** - All related files together
5. **Scalable** - Easy to add more sync features
