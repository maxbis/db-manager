# 💾 Saved Queries - LocalStorage Edition

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Your saved queries feature now uses **Browser LocalStorage** instead of a database. This means:
- ✅ **Zero setup required** - No database table needed
- ✅ **Instant performance** - No network latency
- ✅ **Works offline** - No server connection needed
- ✅ **Simple & fast** - Pure JavaScript implementation

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Storage Location

Your queries are stored in your **browser's LocalStorage**:
- **Location:** On your computer's hard drive
- **Format:** JSON string in the browser's storage
- **Key:** `savedQueries`
- **Size Limit:** ~5-10 MB (enough for thousands of queries!)

### Where to Find the Data

**View your stored queries:**
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click **Local Storage** → Your domain
4. Look for key: `savedQueries`

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

## 💡 Features

### Smart Organization

- **Table Filtering**: Queries for specific tables show when that table is selected
- **Global Queries**: Queries saved without a table are always visible
- **Recent First**: Most recently used queries appear at the top

### Usage Statistics

Each query tracks:
- **Created Date**: When you first saved it
- **Last Used**: When you last loaded it
- **Use Count**: How many times you've used it

### Query Information Display

Each saved query shows:
- 📋 **Name**: Your descriptive title
- 🔍 **Preview**: First 50 characters of SQL
- 📝 **Description**: Optional details
- 🏷️ **Table Badge**: Associated table (if any)
- 📊 **Usage**: "Used: 5x" counter

## 🔐 Data Storage Details

### What Gets Stored

```javascript
{
  "id": 1737120456789,              // Unique timestamp ID
  "query_name": "Get All Users",    // Your query name
  "query_sql": "SELECT * FROM...",  // The SQL query
  "table_name": "users",            // Associated table (optional)
  "description": "Fetch users",     // Description (optional)
  "created_at": "2025-01-17...",    // ISO timestamp
  "last_used_at": "2025-01-17...",  // Last used timestamp
  "use_count": 5                    // Number of times used
}
```

### Storage Format

All queries are stored as a JSON array:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1737120456789,
    "query_name": "Get All Users",
    "query_sql": "SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 100",
    "table_name": "users",
    "description": "Fetch all users",
    "created_at": "2025-01-17T10:30:00.000Z",
    "last_used_at": "2025-01-17T15:45:00.000Z",
    "use_count": 5
  },
  {
    "id": 1737121234567,
    "query_name": "Monthly Sales",
    "query_sql": "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE...",
    "table_name": "orders",
    "description": null,
    "created_at": "2025-01-17T11:00:00.000Z",
    "last_used_at": null,
    "use_count": 0
  }
]
```

## 📊 Capacity & Limits

### Storage Limits

| Browser | Limit per Domain |
|---------|------------------|
| Chrome  | 10 MB |
| Firefox | 10 MB |
| Safari  | 5 MB |
| Edge    | 10 MB |

### Practical Capacity

Assuming average query is ~200 characters:
- **5 MB** = ~25,000 queries
- **10 MB** = ~50,000 queries

**Realistically:** You'll store 10-100 queries, using only **~5-50 KB**

---

## ⚡ Performance

### Speed Comparison

| Operation | LocalStorage | Database (Old) |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Save**   | <1ms | 20-100ms |
| **Load**   | <1ms | 10-50ms |
| **Delete** | <1ms | 20-100ms |
| **List**   | <1ms | 10-50ms |

**LocalStorage is 10-100x faster!** 🚀

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### What LocalStorage IS:
- ✅ Isolated per domain
- ✅ Not sent over network
- ✅ Protected by Same-Origin Policy
- ✅ Not accessible by other websites

### What LocalStorage IS NOT:
- ❌ Not encrypted (plain text storage)
- ❌ Not protected from XSS attacks
- ❌ Not for sensitive data (passwords, etc.)

### For SQL Queries:
- ✅ **SAFE** - SQL queries are not sensitive data
- ✅ **APPROPRIATE** - Perfect use case
- ✅ **FAST** - No network overhead

---

## ⚠️ Data Persistence

### When Data Is Preserved:
- ✅ Closing and reopening browser
- ✅ Browser updates
- ✅ Computer restarts
- ✅ Opening new tabs/windows

### When Data Might Be Lost:
- ❌ User clears browser data/cache
- ❌ User deletes "Cookies and site data"
- ❌ Using Incognito/Private browsing mode
- ❌ Running out of disk space (rare)

### 💡 Backup Strategy:
**Export your queries regularly!**
1. Click **⬇️ Export** button
2. Save the JSON file somewhere safe
3. Re-import if needed with **⬆️ Import** button

---

## 🔄 Export/Import Details

### Export File Format

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "exported_at": "2025-01-17T10:30:00.000Z",
  "query_count": 5,
  "queries": [
    { /* your queries here */ }
  ]
}
```

### Import Behavior

- **Merges** with existing queries (doesn't replace)
- **Skips duplicates** (same name + same SQL)
- **Assigns new IDs** to avoid conflicts
- **Shows results** (e.g., "Imported 5 queries (2 duplicates skipped)")

### Use Cases for Export/Import:

1. **Backup**: Regular exports for safety
2. **Transfer**: Move queries to another browser/computer
3. **Share**: Share useful queries with teammates
4. **Version Control**: Commit exports to git repository
5. **Restore**: Recover after clearing browser data

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Regular Backups
**Export weekly or after adding important queries**
```
📅 Monday: Export queries → Save to cloud/USB
```

### 2. Clear Naming
Use descriptive names:
- ✅ "Get Active Users Last 30 Days"
- ✅ "Monthly Revenue Report"
- ❌ "Query 1"
- ❌ "test"

### 3. Add Descriptions
Help your future self:
```
Name: Customer Purchase History
Description: Returns last 30 days of purchases for customers 
             with total spend > $100. Used for monthly reports.
```

### 4. Associate Tables
Save queries for specific tables to keep them organized

### 5. Clean Up
Delete queries you no longer use to keep the list manageable

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key JavaScript Functions

```javascript
// Save query
localStorage.setItem('savedQueries', JSON.stringify(queries));

// Load queries
const queries = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('savedQueries') || '[]');

// Delete query
queries = queries.filter(q => q.id !== queryId);
localStorage.setItem('savedQueries', JSON.stringify(queries));
```

### Data Flow

```
User Action → JavaScript Function → LocalStorage API → Browser Storage
     ↓              ↓                      ↓                  ↓
  Click Save → saveQueryToDatabase() → localStorage.setItem() → Disk
```

## 🆚 LocalStorage vs Database

### Why LocalStorage is Better for You:

| Feature | LocalStorage ✅ | Database ❌ |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Setup | None | Create table |
| Speed | Instant | Network delay |
| Offline | Works | Doesn't work |
| Backup | Export button | Database backup |
| Sharing | Export/Import | Built-in |
| Multi-user | Per browser | Shared |

### When to Use Database Instead:

- Multiple users need same queries
- Queries must be shared across team
- Central management required
- Audit trail needed

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No saved queries yet" message

**This is normal!** Start saving queries.

### Queries disappeared after clearing browser data

**Solution:** Import your backup JSON file

### Can't save queries

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors (F12)
2. LocalStorage is enabled (not blocked)
3. Not in Incognito/Private mode
4. Storage quota not exceeded (very unlikely)

### Export doesn't work

**Check:**
1. Pop-up blocker settings
2. Download folder permissions
3. Browser allows file downloads

### Import doesn't work

**Check:**
1. File is valid JSON
2. File was exported from this app
3. File isn't corrupted
